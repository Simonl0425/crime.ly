Maps utilizing SF Open Data - Built apart of Hack Against Violence

## Problem
Crime is prevalent in the Bay Area, and it is hard to know what neighborhoods are safe to walk around in unless you are from the area. We wanted to create a way for users to be more aware of where crimes occur throughout San Francisco so they can make smarter, safer choices.

## Our Solution
Utilizing crime reports listed in SF Open Data and Google's Maps API, we created a website with all the crime reports laid out on a map. This allows users to see what areas have higher incidences of crime, and what crimes are committed in those areas.

## Getting Started
When you open the map, all the crime reports from the past year are displayed across San Francisco. We color-coded the different categories, red representing more dangerous crimes and showing what areas you would want to be most careful in. We added a drop down filter for specific categories so that you can also look at what areas certain crimes occur in.
